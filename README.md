# OurDailyBread

OurDailyBread is a web application created for the Sunday School members of the Eritrean Trinity Orthodox Church. The platform provides a space to teach, read, and share spiritual content, helping members grow together in faith and knowledge.

## Mission

- Enrich the community by sharing spiritual insights and teachings.
- Support newcomers and those less experienced by providing accessible resources.
- Strengthen fellowship through collaboration, discussion, and knowledge sharing.
