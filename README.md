# OurDailyBread  

OurDailyBread is a web application created for the Sunday School members of the Eritrean Trinity Orthodox Church. The platform provides a space to teach, read, and share spiritual content, helping members grow together in faith and knowledge.  

## Mission  
- Enrich the community by sharing spiritual insights and teachings.  
- Support newcomers and those less experienced by providing accessible resources.  
- Strengthen fellowship through collaboration, discussion, and knowledge sharing.  

By combining learning with community engagement, OurDailyBread fosters an environment where every member—whether experienced or new—can contribute, learn, and deepen their spiritual journey.
